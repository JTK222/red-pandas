1.15.2:
- 1.0.2:
Decreased the spawn rate from 10 to 4. Hopefully they won't take over the world now.
Added two biomes to the whitelist, Bamboo forest and Bamboo forest hills.
The config is now stored in the old "config" directory instead of the world save folder.
Added bamboo drops to the red panda to bring it in line with vanilla.

- 1.0.1:
I forgot to add in the spawning code to make red pandas spawn in the world...
Config for this is stored per world.

- 1.0.0:
Initial alpha release.
